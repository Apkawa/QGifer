All the translation files are placed in "translations" directory. 

Use the "template.ts" file for new translations. The "LANGUAGE_NAME" field should be translated to the native name of destination language (ex. "Polski" for polish). 

Exported .qm files should be placed in "locale" directory or "/usr/share/qgifer/locale" if the app is already installed on linux.
